# Impact_of_Car_Features_Analysis :-

# Introduction :

· The automotive industry has been rapidly evolving over the past few decades, with a growing focus on fuel efficiency, environmental sustainability, and technological innovation.

· With increasing competition among manufacturers and a changing consumer landscape, it has become more important than ever to understand the factors that drive consumer demand for cars.

· In this project, for the given dataset, we analyze how can a car manufacturer optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand.

· This problem could be approached by analyzing the relationship between a car's features, market category, and pricing, and identifying which features and categories are most popular among consumers and most profitable for the manufacturer.

# Approach :

· The dataset contains information on various car models and their specifications, and is titled "Car Features and MSRP". It was collected and made available on Kaggle by Cooper Union, a private college located in New York City.

· Have done the data cleaning by removing the duplicates and null values.

· Used appropriate excel functions & formulas and pivot tables to get the requried answers for each questions.

· Created a interactive dashboard for all the key tasks.

## Tools & Technologies Used :

· Microsoft Excel (2019) & it's functions and forumulas.

## KPI's :

### 1) Popularity of a Car Model:

· Created a pivot table that shows the number of car models in each market category and their corresponding average popularity scores.

· This helps to identify the category that has high number of car models and the high average popularity score as well.

· Visualised the same using the combo chart to show the relationship between categories and popularity scores.

### 2) Car's Engine Power Vs Its Price:

· Visualised the relationship between engine power of the car and its price using a scatter plot and added a trend line to see the pattern.

### 3) Car Features Vs Price:

· This analysis helps in identifying which car features are most important in determining a car's price.

· Used regression analysis to identify the variables that have the strongest relationship with a car's price and then created a bar chart that shows the coefficient values for each variable to visualize their relative importance.

### 4) Average Price of Car Vs Manufacturers:

· Created a pivot table that shows the average price of cars for each manufacturer.

· Visualised the same using horizontal bar chart that shows the relationship between manufacturer and average price.


### 5) Fuel Efficiency Vs No. of Cylinders (Engine):

· This KPI shows the summary of no. of cylinders and their fuel efficiency (Highway MPG).

· Calculated the correlation coefficient using excel function "CORREL" and visualised the result using a scatter chart.

## Dashboards :

· Created a interactive dashboard that contains all the following key compoents/insights and different slicers.

### 1--> Car Price Vs Brand & Body Style:

· Created two pivot tables that shows the total & average price values of the car for different brands and body style.

· Added a slicer for 'Make' & 'Vehicle Style' columns to make the dashboard more interactive.

### 2--> Car Price Vs Transmission Type & Body Style:

· Created a pivot table that shows the price value of the car for different transmission type and body style.

· Added a slicer for 'Transmission Type' & 'Vehicle Style' columns to make the dashboard more interactive and visualised the result using scatter plot.

### 3--> Fuel Efficiency Vs Vehicle Style Over Years:

· This KPI shows the trend of fuel efficiency (MPG) over time for each body style.

· We can see the fuel efficiency is increasing / decreasing in over a period and the fuel efficiency for the latest year is high compared to average fuel efficiency over years.

· Inserted a year slicer to make the dashboard more interactive.

### 4--> Car's Horsepower, MPG, and Price Vs Brands:

· Created a table that shows the average of HP, MPG & price for different branded cars.

· Visualised the result using a bubble chart.

## Conclusion :

· The profitability of car models is closely linked to the inclusion of high-margin features. Features that are expensive to produce but highly desired by consumers can lead to increased profit margins. Conversely, basic or standard features often contribute less to profitability, highlighting the importance of strategic feature selection in maximizing financial returns.

· The study underscores the importance of understanding competitive positioning. Car manufacturers that strategically leverage distinctive features can differentiate themselves in the market, influencing both pricing and profitability. This competitive edge often translates to increased market share and improved financial performance.

· Car features play a crucial role in shaping vehicle prices and profitability. Automakers that effectively analyze and integrate these features into their product offerings can enhance their market position and achieve greater financial success. Future research should focus on emerging technologies and their potential impact on the automotive industry to continue guiding strategic decision-making.
